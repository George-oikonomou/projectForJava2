In class our calendar I have added an TimeTeller object called "teller"

this object has a method :

teller.now() that prints the time right now in this format : 2023-11-10T22:57:39.444914361

you can be more specific by adding lets say year :

teller.now().year() that prints : 2023

there are a lot of these methods like year to work with

these methods can be useful to determine which events we have to print

from the arrayList of events.
