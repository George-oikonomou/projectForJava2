# 2.ask the teacher if we can have flexibility on time being 00:00 when the event doesnt specify a time
# 3.ask about reminders and how to implement them
# 4.ask the teacher about printUpcomingEvents, if its printing only events, and if not should we print (for projects) the deadline or the datetime?
